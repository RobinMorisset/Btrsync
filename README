To install for the current user only:
sudo apt-get install haskell-platform (can vary depending on your package
    manager. We actually only depend on GHC and Cabal)
cabal update
cabal install

To install for all users, replace "cabal install" by "sudo cabal install
--global")

To use, see btrsync --help.
